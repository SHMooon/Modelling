  #groundnut: emergence date 90 because under 90 and over 90 is not suitable. :897g/m2
  #maize. emergence date will be 57. under or over 57 is not suitable. -> less yield:1815 



#we will chose sevilla because there are more yield from more radiation? 




#explain the situation maize in wageningen: from 30 to 70 same yield 1125... 
#however situation maize in wageningen: 29 -> 1126
#what is the meaing of the range of the emergence date like in wageningen is huge range... 
#in wageningen the ground nut will be yielded at feburary next year.
  #so it is not optimal for next crop on the same field. 
  #and to grown up the goundnut in wageningen takes longer.
